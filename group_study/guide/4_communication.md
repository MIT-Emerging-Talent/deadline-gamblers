# Communication Plan

Decide as a team when you will be able to meet, and how you'll stay in touch
between meetings. The example in this repository gives some ideas for organizing
this file, but it's up to your group to find what works best for you.

This is one of the most important steps in collaboration! Group projects go by very
quickly, often you'll only have one week to plan and deliver a milestone.
Taking a few extra minutes to plan before starting can save you a day or two of confusion during the sprint.

## Meeting Agendas

Writing a meeting agenda ahead of time is always a good idea. There is no right way to plan a meeting, your group should search online and experiment to find what works best for you.

This repository has a _template issue_ you can use to create a meeting agenda. Each time your group is planning a meeting you can create a new issue using this template and write a meeting agenda. You can use comments to discuss before/after the meeting, you can add meeting minutes in the issue body or comments, and close the issue when all meeting points have been addressed.
